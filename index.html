    <h1> Gracia's World 🐇 </h1>

    <h2 style="color:black;"> ☆ A little bit about me ☆ </h2>
    <p> My name is Gracia Kassis and I am a Biochemistry Major and Neuroscience Minor in the MAT program. It's my last year at Mcgill and I'm very interested in both scientific research and developing myself in music - and I hope to some day be able to work in both :) </p>
    
    <h2 style="color: black;"> ୨୧ Interests! </h2>
    <p> My favorite genres of music range between Rock, Jazz, Pop, Classical, fusions between those and almost anything in 3/4. My favorite instruments would probably have to be the cello, piano, glockenspiel, accordion, clavinet and bandoneon. I would say I'm an enjoyer of silly things in general! If I were to make a little board of photos that represented me it would look a little like this: </p>
